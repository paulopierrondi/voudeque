## Current Operating Model

Cursor Background Agent is dormant. Do not route work to Cursor unless Paulo explicitly asks.

Use current coders:

| Need | Coder | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Broad scan, triage, report, backlog | Kimi CLI | cheap/read-only/report-first |
| Patch, test, integration, local verification | Codex | default executor |
| Architecture, hard bug, compliance, App Store/release risk | Claude Code | senior specialist |
| Independent Google-model CLI validation, MCP checks, terminal utility work | Gemini CLI | read `GEMINI.md`; keep `AGENTS.md` and vault rules in sync |
| Agent-first orchestration, Chrome/browser checks, multi-folder/worktree tasks, artifacts | Google Antigravity | read `AGENTS.md` and `GEMINI.md`; use explicit project folder access for vault or rely on `.brain` snapshots |

## Cost Control

- Do not start extra agents without clear owner, task, artifact and stop condition.
- Do not duplicate the same scope across Codex, Claude, Kimi, Gemini and Antigravity.
- Use Kimi for volume, Codex for normal implementation, Claude for complex/high-risk work, Gemini for independent CLI validation, and Antigravity for orchestrated/browser-heavy tasks.
- Stop before secrets, deploy, App Store/TestFlight, paid ads, production migrations, social publishing, force push or multi-repo mutation.

## Prompt Caching

- Follow `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/99_System/Prompt Caching Workflow Policy.md`.
- Stable prefix first: Hub enforcement, project context, gates, checklists, output schema.
- Dynamic delta last: current task, date, live status, diffs, logs, search results.
- Never cache secrets, `.env`, private keys, cookies or `ROTATE_REQUIRED` values.
- Report strategy, prefix version, nonsecret key/tag and cached token telemetry when available.

## Handoff Contract

Every background coder must report:

- What changed or found.
- Files touched or reviewed.
- Commands/tests run.
- Confidence and residual risk.
- Exact next action.
- Whether Obsidian/Linear needs updating.
- Prompt cache strategy and telemetry or reason unavailable.
