Repository: `/Users/paulopierrondi/Projects/voudeque`

This is a non-secret snapshot of the local Obsidian second brain for this repository.

## Required Agent Workflow

1. Read the repo instruction file for your agent: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, or `KIMI.md`. For Google Antigravity, read both `AGENTS.md` and `GEMINI.md`.
2. Read this file before planning work.
3. If local vault access exists, prefer the live Obsidian notes over this snapshot.
4. If running in cloud without local vault access, use this file as the project memory source.
5. Select the relevant best-practice notes and checklists: app/web quality, screenshots, marketing creative/video, frontend, backend/API, web, iOS, Android, AI, release and security.
6. Never store real API keys or secrets in Markdown. Store only inventory metadata.
7. Capture reusable development lessons in the Learning Inbox or `.brain/SESSION_NOTES.md` when the vault is unavailable.
8. After meaningful work, update the live Obsidian project note or append durable context to `.brain/SESSION_NOTES.md`.

# Paulo Pierrondi Profile

This is required user context for Codex/GPT, Claude Code, Kimi and Gemini.

## Executive Summary

Paulo works across enterprise tech, personal products, family and faith. He is a Technical Account Executive at ServiceNow, focused on the Banco Bradesco account in Brazil, while also building side projects and monetizable frameworks/IP. He prefers direct, structured, information-dense responses with honest analytical pushback. Brazil-facing content defaults to Portuguese.

## Response Style

- Lead with the answer.
- Use executive summary first for complex topics.
- Use bullets and tables when they improve clarity.
- Be direct, dense and copy-paste ready.
- Avoid fluff, motivational tone and vague encouragement.
- Use PT-BR for Brazil-facing material.
- Analogies and frameworks are useful when they sharpen thinking.
- Push back when assumptions are weak, but keep the tone pragmatic.
- Prefer metrics, tradeoffs, explicit risks and next actions.
- Do not end with soft filler such as "se fizer sentido".

## Professional Context

- Role: Technical Account Executive (TAE) at ServiceNow, global team.
- Primary account: Banco Bradesco, FSI Brazil.
- Works with Rodrigo Rezende (Client Director) and Joao Saes (SC).
- Coordinates with Impact and CEG/Services.
- Recurring themes:
  - Bradesco account strategy.
  - CMDB/CSDM transformation.
  - Now Assist and AI Agents.
  - Governance and operating model.
  - FSI positioning.
  - 2026 roadmap.

## Personal Context

- Carioca.
- Lived for a long period in Dublin.
- Currently based in Sao Jose dos Campos, SP.
- Married, family-oriented.
- Faith-oriented worldview.
- Entrepreneurial mindset.
- Active interest in monetizing frameworks and IP.
- US or EMEA relocation is on the radar.

## Top Of Mind

- `pptx-engine`: TypeScript/Node.js CLI for executive deck generation, multi-LLM with Claude and GPT-4, four-phase architecture.
- Claude Code as autonomous long-running agents, including 8-hour runs, across apps such as `exploratorio` and `investcoach_ai`.
- Now Assist Bradesco Operating Model is active.
- Critical open question: direct ServiceNow investment versus Bradesco-authorized budget.

## Bradesco Live Context

- CMDB program organized in four plateaus:
  1. Fundacao.
  2. Fonte Unica.
  3. Conexao Negocio.
  4. Excelencia.
- Accenture is the primary executor, around 800 hours.
- Other partners: NTT, IBM and 4MATT.
- Governance stakeholders:
  - Edson: sponsor.
  - Fabio: strategic forum.
  - Marcena: operational forum.
  - Rodolfo and Rogerio: technical CCB.
- Recurring bottleneck: COI/Sayumi after the January SPM incident.
- Terminology rules:
  - Use `SPM`, not `ITBM`.
  - Use `forum`, not `committee/comite`, unless quoting source material.
  - `Cilmara` is spelled with C.

## Tools And Frameworks

- Claude Code skills:
  - `servicenow-project-pptx`.
  - `bradesco-project-pptx`.
- MCP `servicenow-ai-demo` for `cmdb_ci` queries.
- CMDB context: 61K+ records, with gaps in ownership, serial and IP.
- Framework SADA.
- CSDM Data Quality Analyzer:
  - Python.
  - Bilingual.
  - FSO/regulatory focus.

## Now Assist Editorial Rule

Every Bradesco Now Assist material must explicitly connect:

`operating model -> adoption velocity -> revenue expansion`

## How Agents Should Use This

- Before career, executive, ServiceNow, Bradesco, FSI, Now Assist, CSDM, deck, roadmap or positioning work, read this note.
- When writing for Bradesco or Brazil stakeholders, default to PT-BR and executive density.
- When writing internal or global ServiceNow strategy, keep terminology precise and avoid over-claiming.
- When creating decks, use a consultant-style structure: thesis, evidence, options, recommendation, risks, decision needed.
- For side projects, connect product decisions to monetization, distribution, operational leverage and reusable IP.
- For personal/career questions, balance enterprise credibility, entrepreneurial upside, family constraints, faith-aligned values and relocation optionality.

## Non-Goals

- Do not invent private facts beyond this profile and the project notes.
- Do not over-personalize routine code answers.
- Do not turn faith/family into generic motivational content.
- Do not expose personal or enterprise-sensitive details outside the intended context.

# Prompt Caching Workflow Policy

## Rule

All recurring, high-token, multi-agent or production-adjacent AI workflows must be cache-aware.

The required prompt shape is:

```text
CACHEABLE_PREFIX_START
stable operating contract
stable agent / workflow policy
stable project context
stable quality gates
stable output schema
CACHEABLE_PREFIX_END

DYNAMIC_TASK_START
current date, live state, user request, diffs, logs, search results, blockers
DYNAMIC_TASK_END
```

Static context goes first. Dynamic context goes last. Do not mix timestamps, live status, search results, diffs, log tails or user-specific deltas into the cacheable prefix.

## Cacheable Prefix Order

Use this order whenever a workflow builds a prompt, handoff, CLI request or API call:

1. System role and non-negotiable safety rules.
2. Agent Hub enforcement and human gates.
3. Paulo profile, response style and operating preferences.
4. Runtime/provider routing policy.
5. Project static context: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `KIMI.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `CODEX_RULES.md`, `.brain/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.
6. Reusable checklists, quality gates, App Store rules, security policy and output contracts.
7. Tool schemas or structured output schema.
8. Dynamic task delta only after `CACHEABLE_PREFIX_END`.

## Never Cache

Do not include these in cacheable prefixes:

- API keys, tokens, cookies, private keys, `.env` values, session exports or credential screenshots.
- Current date/time, git dirty lists, live Linear issue bodies, App Store live status, provider dashboard state, web search results, logs, diffs or stack traces.
- Personal data or private note content that is not required by the workflow.
- Anything marked `ROTATE_REQUIRED`.

Secrets must stay in provider env vars, Keychain, 1Password when available, or approved secret-intake flows. The vault stores references and metadata only.

## Provider Mapping

| Provider / surface | Cache mechanism | Required workflow behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI / Codex / OpenAI API | Automatic prompt caching for exact repeated prefixes on eligible long prompts; optional `prompt_cache_key`; optional `prompt_cache_retention`; usage exposes `cached_tokens` | Keep identical static prefix, put dynamic task last, use a stable `prompt_cache_key` when direct API calls share a prefix, and log `cached_tokens` when surfaced. |
| Anthropic / Claude API | Automatic or explicit `cache_control` breakpoints; default 5 minute TTL; optional 1 hour TTL; tool definitions can be cached | Put `cache_control` on the last stable block, not on timestamp or task delta. Keep stable tools/system/messages ordered; use deferred tools where available to avoid invalidating the prefix. |
| Gemini API | Implicit caching on supported models plus explicit cached content objects for guaranteed savings; usage metadata exposes cached token counts | Create/reuse cached content for stable docs; send only task delta as fresh prompt when direct API supports it. Put large common content at the beginning for implicit cache hits. |
| Kimi / Moonshot API | Context Caching with cache tags and `role=cache` references | Cache stable files/context with a workflow tag; pass `role=cache` reference plus task delta when direct API supports it. |
| CLI wrappers without direct cache controls | Stable prefix file plus dynamic task file | Keep prefix files byte-stable; pass current task as suffix. Record strategy as `cli-prefix-layout`. |

## Cache Keys

When a workflow can control cache routing or tag names, use a stable key with this shape:

```text
paulo:{workflow_id}:{agent_id}:{project_id}:{policy_version}:{context_version}
```

Do not include dates, branch names that churn daily, live issue titles or secrets in cache keys.

## Required Telemetry

Every recurring workflow report, run note or email must include a redacted prompt-cache block:

```yaml
prompt_cache:
  policy: "/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/99_System/Prompt Caching Workflow Policy.md"
  strategy: "openai-auto | anthropic-cache-control | gemini-cached-content | kimi-context-cache | cli-prefix-layout | not-supported"
  cache_key_or_tag: "redacted-or-nonsecret"
  prefix_version: "YYYY-MM-DD-or-hash"
  prefix_hash_recorded: true
  cached_tokens: null
  input_tokens: null
  output_tokens: null
  cache_hit_rate: null
  notes: "metrics unavailable in this CLI" 
```

If a CLI does not expose token telemetry, record `null` and explain the strategy used. Absence of telemetry is a workflow quality issue, not a blocker for urgent execution.

## Tool And Schema Hygiene

Provider docs agree that cache invalidation is usually caused by changing the prefix. For agent workflows:

- Keep always-needed tools and structured output schemas stable.
- Put optional or discovered tools after the cacheable prefix when the runtime supports deferred tool loading.
- Do not toggle web search

# Linear App + Git Development Tracking OS

Status: active
Owner: Paulo
Updated: 2026-05-16

This is the operating system for keeping the Linear app, Git and the Obsidian second brain aligned. `brain-linear-sync` is useful, but it is not the source of truth for Linear. The Linear app connector is the source of truth for projects, issues, cycles/sprints, statuses, labels, assignees, comments and project updates.

## Sources Of Truth

- Code and local state: Git repositories.
- Product/development queue: Linear app workspace `Agentcore`.
- Durable memory: Obsidian project notes, AI history and `.brain/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.
- Local machine report: [[04_Areas/Coding/Linear/Linear Git Sync Report]] generated by `brain-linear-sync`; this is only Git metadata + mapping hints.
- Live Linear objects: read through the Linear app connector before planning, status, sprint/cycle or cleanup decisions.
- Linear mapping notes: [[04_Areas/Coding/Linear/Linear Project Map]].
- Cleanup queue: [[04_Areas/Coding/Linear/Linear Cleanup Backlog]].

## Required Start Gate

Before planning or coding in any project:

1. Run `brain-linear-sync` or read the latest [[04_Areas/Coding/Linear/Linear Git Sync Report]] for local Git state only.
2. Read the matching project note from [[02_Projects/Projects Index]].
3. Read matching AI history under [[03_AI-Chats/AI Chats Index]] when relevant.
4. Use the Linear app connector to read the live Linear project/issue whenever the task is roadmap, bug, status, scope, priority, release, sprint/cycle, automation, product planning or backlog cleanup related.
5. For a normal coding chat, identify the likely Linear issue before edits. If no issue exists and the task is more than a tiny one-off, create or propose a Linear issue instead of letting work disappear into chat history.
6. Check branch, dirty files, ahead/behind state, live Linear status, cycle/sprint and assignee before editing.

## Required Finish Gate

After meaningful work:

- Update the Obsidian project note with decisions, commands, files changed, risks, deploy state and next steps.
- Update the Linear issue when issue reality changed: status, assignee, priority, labels, cycle/sprint, blocker, evidence or completion state.
- Add a Linear comment/status summary when work produced meaningful evidence but should not change status yet.
- Keep Linear issue links in the project note when a task is driven by Linear.
- Store no secrets in Linear or Obsidian. Secret values stay in providers or secret managers.
- If the work creates reusable practice, add it to [[04_Areas/Coding/Best Practices/Learning Inbox]].

## Linear Connector Rules

- Use the Linear app connector for live reads: projects, issues, cycles/sprints, labels, statuses, assignees, comments and project status updates.
- Do not treat [[04_Areas/Coding/Linear/Linear Git Sync Report]] as a substitute for live Linear. It only says which repos look mapped or unmapped from local metadata.
- Every new chat that performs coding/project work must either attach itself to an existing Linear issue/project or explicitly record why no Linear update is appropriate.
- Do not bulk-close, archive, delete, relabel or assign without an explicit cleanup step.
- Automation can generate cleanup proposals, not destructive changes.
- Treat old `Done` issues with missing labels/assignees as cleanup candidates, not coding blockers.
- Treat `In Progress` issues with stale Git repos as daily-priority candidates.
- Treat cycles/sprints as planning data: read current/next cycles before moving work into or out of sprint scope.

## Daily Sync Output

Daily sync should produce:

- Git repo health: dirty/ahead/behind/stale/unmapped.
- Linear app health: active projects, current/next cycles, stale `In Progress`, high-priority `Todo`, backlog overload, unlabeled/unassigned issues, orphan issues with no project and projects with stale status updates.
- Project note updates for active repos.
- Cleanup proposals in [[04_Areas/Coding/Linear/Linear Cleanup Backlog]].
- Learning candidates for best practices.

## Organic Prompt For Coders

Use this at the start of a new coding session:

```text
Read the Obsidian second brain preflight, run or inspect brain-linear-sync for Git state, then use the Linear app connector to read the matching project/issue/cycle/status before edits. Continue from project memory. After meaningful work, update the project note and the live Linear issue/project if reality changed. Do not store secrets.
```

## Cloud / Other Machine Rule

Cloud coders and other machines will not automatically have the local vault. They must use:

- `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md` or `KIMI.md`.
- `.brain/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.
- `.brain/CLAUDE_CLOUD_CONTEXT.md` when present.
- Live Linear app connector if available. If unavailable, say so clearly and leave a concrete Linear update proposal for the nex

# Linear Project Map

Updated: 2026-05-28

This map links Linear projects to local repos and Obsidian project notes. It is mapping metadata only.

Important: this note is not the Linear source of truth. Always verify live projects/issues/cycles through the Linear app connector before updating status, scope, sprint/cycle, labels or assignees.

# Automation Email Policy

Regra fixa: toda automacao, independente de rodar em Codex, Claude, Kimi/OpenClaw, Gemini, LaunchAgent local, cloud runner ou script agendado, deve enviar um email de encerramento para `pierrondi@gmail.com`.

## Obrigatorio

- Enviar email ao final de cada run, tanto em sucesso quanto em falha.
- Destinatario padrao unico: `pierrondi@gmail.com`.
- Assunto deve identificar automacao e status.
- Corpo deve incluir:
  - nome/id da automacao;
  - status final;
  - horario;
  - principais mudancas/achados;
  - arquivos/relatorios atualizados;
  - decisoes humanas pendentes;
  - falhas ou bloqueios.
- Redigir segredos antes do envio.

## Transporte Local Padrao

Em automacoes locais no Mac, usar:

```bash
/Users/paulopierrondi/.local/bin/brain-send-automation-email --automation "<id>" --status "<success|failed>" --log "<path>"
```

Para LaunchAgents ou `run.sh`, usar o wrapper/trap:

```bash
/Users/paulopierrondi/.local/bin/brain-run-with-email --automation "<id>" --log "<path>" -- <command>
```

ou:

```bash
source /Users/paulopierrondi/.local/bin/brain-automation-email-trap
brain_automation_email_setup "<id>"
```

## Cloud / Connector Rule

Se a automacao rodar fora do Mac local:

- usar o conector/ferramenta de email disponivel para enviar a `pierrondi@gmail.com`;
- se nao houver transporte de email disponivel, criar um draft em Markdown e registrar `EMAIL_FAILED` em [[99_System/Automation Email Log]];
- a falha de transporte deve aparecer no relatorio final e no vault.

## Guardrails

- Esta regra e a unica excecao padrao a "nao enviar mensagens externas".
- Nao enviar email para terceiros automaticamente.
- Nao anexar `.env`, tokens, API keys, cookies, private keys, credenciais, dumps de banco, PII bruta ou logs sem redacao.
- Nao usar `/usr/bin/mail` direto para Gmail; usar Mail.app/iCloud local quando no Mac.
- Se o email falhar, salvar draft seguro em [[99_System/Automation Email Drafts]].

# Credential Vault Operating Model

## Answer First

O Obsidian pode ser o **cofre operacional** das credenciais, mas nao deve guardar o **valor real** de API keys, tokens, senhas, cookies, private keys ou arquivos `.env`.

Modelo correto:

```text
Obsidian             = indice, inventario, runbook, owner, escopo, rotacao, referencia
/Projects/.keys.env       = fonte unica local para files e automacoes (chmod 600, gitignored)
Apple Keychain       = cofre durable de valores (paulo-second-brain namespace)
1Password (futuro)   = referencias multi-machine via op://...
Provider env vars    = runtime/producao (Railway, Vercel, GitHub Actions)
```

Carregamento canonico em scripts locais: `brain-env-run -- <comando>`. Detalhes operacionais em [[99_System/Central Env File Operating Model]].

## Por que nao guardar segredo real em Markdown

- O Obsidian guarda notas como arquivos Markdown em texto plano no filesystem local.
- Obsidian Sync pode proteger o remote vault, mas o vault local continua legivel para qualquer processo/usuario com acesso ao Mac desbloqueado.
- Plugins, indexadores, backups, search, logs, screenshots e agentes podem acabar lendo o conteudo.
- LLMs e automacoes devem usar referencias e inventario, nao receber valor real.

## Onde guardar o valor real

| Variaveis compartilhadas entre projetos locais | `/Users/paulopierrondi/Projects/.keys.env` (chmod 600, gitignored) carregado via `brain-env-run` | Fonte unica para files e automacoes; precedence aceita override por projeto. |
| Override por projeto local | `./.env` no diretorio do projeto | Aplicado apos o central, vence em conflito. |
| Senhas/passkeys pessoais | Apple Passwords / iCloud Keychain ou 1Password | Sync seguro com devices aprovados. |
| API keys de desenvolvimento durable | 1Password Developer / 1Password CLI | Permite `op://...` references e `op run` sem plaintext. |
| Secrets de producao Railway/Vercel/Netlify/Fly/Render | Provider env vars | O runtime injeta sem passar pelo vault. |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions Secrets ou provider equivalente | Separacao de acesso por repo/env. |
| Cloud enterprise | AWS/GCP/Azure secret manager | IAM, audit, rotacao e least privilege. |
| Fallback local Mac | Apple Keychain via `brain-load-secrets`/`brain-secret-intake` | Bom para credenciais humanas e backing durable do `.env` central. |

## O que o vault deve guardar

Guardar em [[04_Areas/Coding/Checklists/Secrets And API Keys Register]]:

- Nome da env var.
- Provider.
- Projeto/repos que usam.
- Ambiente: local, staging, prod, CI.
- Onde o valor real esta guardado.
- Referencia segura, quando houver, como `op://vault/item/field`.
- Escopo/permissao.
- Owner.
- Data de criacao/rotacao.
- Procedimento de revogacao.
- Evidencia de que `.env.example` existe sem valor real.

## O que o vault nunca deve guardar

- API key real.
- Bearer token, refresh token, session token ou cookie.
- Senha.
- Private key `.p8`, `.pem`, `.key`, `.p12`.
- Service account JSON.
- `.env` completo.
- Screenshot mostrando credenciais.
- Output de CLI que imprima secrets.

## Padrao recomendado para Paulo

### 1. `/Users/paulopierrondi/Projects/.keys.env` como fonte unica local

Carregar com `brain-env-run`:

```bash
brain-env-run -- npm run dev
brain-env-run -- python3 scripts/factory.py
brain-env-run list           # mostra apenas nomes
brain-env-run check          # confirma chmod 600 e contagem de keys
```

Regras: `chmod 600`, gitignored, nunca em Markdown/chat/Linear/email/screenshot. Detalhes em [[99_System/Central Env File Operating Model]].

### 2. Apple Keychain como backing durable do `.env` central

`brain-secret-intake` grava no Keychain; `brain-load-secrets` exporta no shell ou subprocess. Useful para regerar o `.env` central apos rotacao ou em maquina nova. Receita completa em [[99_System/Central Env File Operating Model]].

### 3. 1Password como cofre principal multi-machine (futuro)

Quando `op` estiver instalado:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="op://Developer/OpenAI/api-key"
op run -- npm run dev
```

Regra: `.env.op` pode guardar referencias `op://...`; `.env.local` com valor real fica local e gitignored.

### 4. Apple Passwords / iCloud Keychain para credenciais humanas

Usar para contas, passkeys, senhas de apps e acesso no iPhone/Mac. Bom para uso humano; nao e o melhor formato para automacoes de coders porque nao tem referencias `op://...` portaveis por repo.

### 5. Provider env vars para producao

Railway/Vercel/GitHub/etc. continuam fonte de runtime. O vault guarda somente:

```text
RAILWAY_PROJECT=x
RAILWAY_SERVICE=y
ENV_VAR_NAME=OPENAI_API_KEY
stored_at=Railway Variables
value=never stored here
```

## Regras para coders

- Default para automacoes locais: `brain-env-run -- <comando>`. Carrega `/Projects/.keys.env` central + override de projeto, sem ecoar valores.
- Nunca pedir que Paulo co

## Como aprender automaticamente

Todo coder deve registrar aprendizados reutilizaveis em:

- [[04_Areas/Coding/Best Practices/Learning Inbox]]
- [[04_Areas/Coding/Best Practices/Patterns To Promote]]

## Padrões recentemente promovidos

- Authorized security testing: gated request harness (default-deny scope, ≤1 req/s, auto-redacted evidence, no active request without human gate), self-evolution loop (outcomes → lessons → behavior, EV-ranked targets), adversarial self-audit of safety tooling. Ver [[04_Areas/Coding/Best Practices/Authorized Security Testing Engine]].

- Prompt caching e workflow layout: separar prefixo estável de delta dinâmico, registrar `prompt_cache.strategy`, `prefix_version` e telemetria quando houver.
- CLI/headless orchestration: comandos batch devem ter modo não-interativo explícito; quando o CLI default for TUI, usar flag headless/documentada antes de integrar em automação.
- iOS/Android/App Store/Play submissions: smoke real no runtime alvo continua sendo gate obrigatório, mesmo quando lint/build/health check passam.
- Screenshot/release QA: assets de loja e marketing precisam composição final, dimensão exata e validação lado a lado antes do submit.
- Guided tours: cada rota/funcionalidade relevante precisa tour contextual com spotlight correto, persistencia por usuario e validacao desktop/mobile/producao antes de release.
- Complexidade ciclomatica: gate obrigatorio de fim-de-atividade via `complexity-guard.py scan --changed`; nada com funcao acima do teto HARD (CCN 15) fecha sem refator ou waiver logado. Engine universal `lizard` + nativo (`ruff C901`, eslint `complexity`). Ver [[99_System/Cyclomatic Complexity Policy]].

Aprendizado reutilizavel e algo que deve guiar projetos futuros:

- erro recorrente;
- comando canonico melhor;
- convencao de plataforma;
- decisao de arquitetura que se repetiu;
- checklist que faltava;
- risco de seguranca percebido;
- padrao de deploy ou rollback;
- regra de UX/design que melhorou resultado;
- falha visual detectada por screenshot ou viewport;
- regra de store readiness para App Store ou Google Play.

## Regra para agentes

Quando uma sessao terminar, perguntar internamente:

- "Isto ensina algo reutilizavel?"
- "Algum checklist deve ganhar item novo?"
- "Alguma pratica antiga deve ser corrigida?"
- "Isso vale para uma plataforma especifica ou para todos os projetos?"

Se sim, registrar no Learning Inbox ou em `.brain/SESSION_NOTES.md` quando o vault nao estiver acessivel.

## Promocao

Itens do Learning Inbox viram melhores praticas quando:

- aconteceram em mais de um projeto;
- evitaram bug, retrabalho, custo ou risco;
- melhoraram qualidade visual, seguranca, performance ou deploy;
- foram confirmados por teste, build, deploy ou revisao.

# App Web Quality Best Practices

## Principio

Qualidade de app/web e uma combinacao de produto, design, estado, performance, acessibilidade, privacy, store readiness e evidencia visual. **Qualidade sempre sobe. Nunca degrada conscientemente.** Cada release, cada tela, cada screenshot, cada copy substituida deve estar igual ou melhor que a versao anterior. Se um deliverable parece pior que o anterior, ou pior que o competidor, e nao-aceitavel; refazer.

## O padrao Paulo

- Construir a experiencia real primeiro.
- Evitar landing generica quando o pedido e app/ferramenta.
- Todo app precisa nascer com identidade publica completa: icone final forte, landing page publica de padrao superior e links legais vivos. Isso e parte do produto, nao acabamento.
- App icon nunca pode ser placeholder. Antes de review, TestFlight, launch, deck ou paid campaign, validar o icone dentro do build/app instalado, no asset catalog completo da plataforma e na landing/favicons/OG image.
- Landing page publica nunca pode ser resposta JSON, pagina generica ou placeholder. `GET /` deve entregar HTML responsivo, branded, com proposta de valor clara, visual real do produto, CTA, links de suporte/privacy/terms e metadata social/SEO.
- Interfaces operacionais devem ser claras, densas e rapidas.
- Apps consumer podem ser mais expressivos, mas ainda precisam de fluxo obvio.
- Idioma e contrato de produto: cada app precisa declarar um idioma primario canonico por mercado/release e nenhuma rota/tela deve misturar PT/EN por fallback de browser, string hardcoded ou asset antigo. Apps bilingues precisam de locale explicito, switch claro e QA separada por idioma.
- Todo app mobile deve ter uma pequena animacao de abertura contextual ao dominio do app, antes de privacidade/auth/home, sem parecer splash generico e sem atrasar o uso.
- Em app iOS, modificacao significativa so fecha depois de teste funcional no app instalado e upload do novo build para TestFlight/App Store Connect, salvo excecao explicita.
- Screenshots sao deliverable de primeira classe, nao "depois". Submission, release, post, deck, anuncio ou pagina nova so e "feito" quando os arquivos finais artisticos existem, validados e registrados.
- Privacidade e consentimento tambem sao deliverable de primeira classe. Todo app novo precisa ter tela padrao de primeira abertura, links legais vivos e tracking desligado por padrao antes de qualquer SDK/evento de marketing.
- Toda tela importante precisa lidar com loading, erro, vazio e permissao.
- Classificar cada screenshot por finalidade antes da QA final: produto real, store review, marketing, deck preview, teste visual ou dependencia. Screenshot de `node_modules`, fixture ou snapshot de pacote nao prova qualidade do app.

## Privacy and consent

Regra maxima: app sem clareza de privacidade nao esta pronto para TestFlight externo, review, campanha ou launch.

Padrao:
- Primeiro launch deve explicar uso funcional de dados, oferecer links legais e permitir continuar sem tracking.
- Tracking entre apps/sites, IDFA, ads SDK, MMP e medicao de marketing ficam desligados por padrao e exigem decisao explicita de produto.
- Se nao houver tracking, remover SDKs de ads/attribution, SKAdNetwork IDs e chaves client-side do binario final.
- Se houver tracking, ATT/privacy labels/termos/eventos precisam estar coerentes antes do upload.
- Screenshot da tela de consentimento por idioma principal vira evidencia obrigatoria do release.

Guia canonico: [[04_Areas/Coding/Best Practices/Mobile App Privacy Consent Standard]]

## Opening motion

Regra maxima: todo app mobile precisa de uma assinatura curta de abertura, contextual ao produto, local/offline e respeitando acessibilidade.

Padrao:
- Launch screen nativo fica estatico; a animacao acontece dentro do app apos o primeiro frame.
- A animacao usa a metafora real do produto: musica, financas, devocional, escola, saude, foto/video, SaaS etc.
- Primeiro uso pode durar ate `1.6s`; cold start recorrente deve ser mais curto, idealmente `0.4s-0.9s`; nunca passar de `2s`.
- Deve respeitar Reduce Motion e nao depender de backend.
- Nao pode inicializar tracking, ads SDK ou medicao de marketing antes do consentimento aplicavel.
- Evidencia visual da animacao deve ser registrada na nota do projeto quando houver release visual/mobile.

Guia canonico: [[04_Areas/Coding/Best Practices/Mobile App Opening Motion Standard]]

## iOS QA and TestFlight closure

Regra maxima: para app iOS, "feito" nao significa apenas codigo compilando. Significa app testado, build incrementado, archive/export feito e upload TestFlight concluido.

Padrao:
- Ao fechar mudanca iOS significativa, testar no app instalado: cold start/opening motion, privacy/consent, auth/demo ou anonimo, Home, navegacao principal, feature alterada, links legais e APIs relevantes.
- Incrementar build number antes do archive.
- Usar lane/script

## Aprendizados promovidos

- Screenshot de review/store precisa provar plataforma e tamanho, nao apenas "parece bonito".
- App Store/Google Play pedem conjuntos diferentes de evidencia: phone, tablet/large screen quando aplicavel, idioma, dark/light e ausencia de dados sensiveis.
- Imagens de marketing precisam nascer no formato de destino: feed, story, deck, landing, preview e video nao devem reaproveitar crop por acidente.
- Screenshots de UI precisam capturar estado real: loading, empty, erro, permissao, auth, pagamento, onboarding e sucesso.
- Render preview de deck/documento/site e uma forma de teste visual; se nao renderizou, nao esta pronto.
- `node_modules`, package fixtures e snapshots de dependencias nao contam como evidencia do produto.
- O vault deve registrar paths e decisao de qualidade, nao copiar imagens sensiveis nem inflar a memoria com dumps.

## Regra operacional

Quando um agente mexer em app/web visual:

- usar [[04_Areas/Coding/Checklists/Screenshots Visual QA Checklist]];
- registrar os paths de evidencia na nota do projeto;
- transformar falhas recorrentes em item de checklist;
- nao anexar screenshot com segredo, PII, token, cookie ou ambiente de producao exposto.

# Android App Best Practices

## Principios

- Android nao e apenas "iOS portado": respeitar back navigation, intents, permissions, density, large screens e lifecycle.
- Estado do usuario deve sobreviver background, rotacao e navegacao.
- Permissoes perigosas precisam ser minimizadas e pedidas no contexto certo.
- Data safety e privacy policy precisam bater com codigo e SDKs.

## UI

- Usar Material 3 quando estiver no stack.
- Touch targets e fontes precisam escalar.
- Layouts devem funcionar em phone, tablet e foldable quando relevante.
- Dark mode precisa ser intencional, nao acidental.

## Arquitetura

- Segredos nunca entram no APK/AAB.
- Offline e rede ruim precisam de estado explicito.
- Background work deve usar APIs apropriadas e respeitar bateria.
- Analytics/crash SDKs devem estar no inventario de privacy.

## Release

- Version code/name atualizados.
- App Bundle com signing correto.
- Store listing honesta.
- Test track antes de producao.
- Data safety atualizado a cada novo SDK/coleta.

# Agent Workflow Best Practices

## Principios

- Primeiro ler memoria; depois planejar; depois editar.
- Agente nao deve pedir segredo que pode ser acessado via provider/CLI.
- Mudancas devem ser pequenas, verificaveis e registradas.
- Aprendizado reutilizavel deve voltar para o vault.
- Quando houver subagentes, manter ownership claro e nao duplicar o mesmo escopo de escrita.
- Antes de promover um padrao, diferenciar lição madura de caso puntual com dependencias de plataforma.
- Para trabalhos paralelos, cada worker precisa de escopo disjunto, nao pode reverter edits de outros e deve aceitar que a base do codigo nao esta isolada.
- Background Coders ativos sao Codex, Claude Code, Kimi CLI, Gemini CLI e Google Antigravity. Cursor Background Agent fica dormente, salvo ativacao explicita do Paulo.
- `GEMINI.md` deve ficar em paridade operacional com `AGENTS.md`; Gemini CLI usa essa memoria e Antigravity tambem deve conseguir ler `AGENTS.md` + `GEMINI.md`.
- Antigravity deve operar com Project folders explicitos. Se o vault nao estiver no Project, usar `.brain/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` ou pedir acesso ao vault antes de assumir contexto vivo.

## Inicio

- Rodar/usar `brain-preflight`.
- Ler `.brain/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.
- Ler nota do projeto e AI history.
- Ler best practices e checklists relevantes.
- Confirmar comandos canonicos.
- Para trabalho multi-agent, criar primeiro um mission packet com `agent-mastery intake --goal "..."`; usar `--all-core-coders` quando a intencao for acionar Kimi, Qwen, Codex, Gemini, Antigravity e Claude no mesmo desenho operacional.
- Para background work, confirmar `.brain/BACKGROUND_CODER_CONTEXT.md`, owner (`codex`, `claude`, `kimi`, `gemini` ou `antigravity`), issue/tarefa unica, artefato esperado e stop condition.

## Durante

- Nao deixar chat operacional passar de 60% de contexto sem checkpoint. Em 50-55%, rodar `chat-context-guard checkpoint`; em >=60%, produzir resume pack e continuar em novo chat.
- Manter session journal vivo. Preflight escreve automaticamente, mas coders devem rodar `session-journal heartbeat` a cada 10 minutos de trabalho ativo, depois de patch relevante, falha de teste/build, mudanca de fase, human gate ou contexto em 50-55%.
- Usar a superficie certa antes de chamar outro LLM: `llm-routing-guard route --task "..."` quando houver duvida. Codex integra; Claude resolve risco complexo; Kimi pesquisa/triage; Gemini valida; Antigravity faz browser/visual/worktree; Qwen faz draft isolado.
- Usar a tool certa antes de executar: `tool-usage-guard route --task "..."` quando houver duvida. Obsidian registra memoria duravel; Linear registra realidade viva de produto; Git/GitHub registra codigo/PR/CI; CodeGraph responde estrutura de codigo; Browser/Antigravity prova visual/browser; secrets ficam fora de Markdown/chat/logs.
- Preservar mudancas do usuario.
- Evitar refactor fora do escopo.
- Usar ferramentas seguras para secrets: Railway, provider env vars, 1Password/Keychain.
- Nao imprimir env completo.
- Nao pedir a nenhum background coder para operar secrets, deploy, App Store/TestFlight, paid ads, social publishing, migrations de producao ou multi-repo changes sem aprovacao explicita.

## Fim

- Atualizar nota do projeto.
- Atualizar `.brain/SESSION_NOTES.md` se sem vault.
- Registrar aprendizado em [[04_Areas/Coding/Best Practices/Learning Inbox]] quando reutilizavel.
- Sugerir promocao para best practice quando padrao aparecer de novo.
- Se a entrega veio de background coder, registrar owner, handoff aceito/rejeitado e atualizar Linear apenas depois de validação local.

## Aprendizados locais

- Adicionar aqui comportamento que melhorou entregas dos coders.

- 2026-05-21: Cursor Background Agent deve entrar no Hub como worker remoto de branch/PR pequeno, nunca como integrador final. Ele usa snapshots `.brain` e `.cursor/rules`; Codex/Claude local valida e Obsidian/Linear registram a realidade.
- 2026-05-21: Paulo decidiu nao abrir Cursor por ora. Background work deve ficar embutido nos coders atuais: Kimi para volume/triagem, Codex para patch/integracao, Claude Code para complexidade/compliance, Gemini CLI para validacao independente/MCP/terminal e Antigravity para orquestracao/browser/worktree/artefatos. Cursor fica dormente.
- 2026-05-21: Gemini CLI e Google Antigravity entram como coders ativos no Hub. Gemini cobre validacao independente/MCP/terminal com `GEMINI.md`; Antigravity cobre orquestracao agent-first, browser/Chrome, worktrees, subagentes e artefatos com `AGENTS.md` + `GEMINI.md`.
- 2026-05-25: Multi-agent work deve comecar por mission packet, nao por prompt solto. `agent-mastery.py` gera `mission.md`, `status.json` e handoff prompts com owner, artefato, stop condition, hard gates e prompt cache antes de qualquer dispatch.
- 2026-05-25: Contexto de chat e recurso operacional finito. Em 50-55%, checkpoint obrigatorio;

# App Web Preflight Checklist

Este e o preflight mais importante antes de criar, alterar ou revisar qualquer app, web app, site, tela, fluxo, release, screenshot ou submission.

## 0. Classificar o trabalho

- [ ] Tipo: web app, site, iOS, Android, cross-platform, backend-for-frontend, landing, dashboard, game, marketing page.
- [ ] Plataforma alvo primaria definida.
- [ ] Plataforma secundaria definida.
- [ ] Usuario alvo e momento de uso definidos.
- [ ] Fluxo principal em uma frase.
- [ ] Risco principal: design, dados, auth, pagamento, store review, performance, privacy, AI, deploy.

## 0.1 Regra maxima de ads tracking

> Todo app novo ou em uso precisa ter tracking de aquisicao e performance de ads como requisito de produto, nao como tarefa de marketing posterior.

- [ ] Mobile app: TikTok App Events SDK ou MMP equivalente planejado/implementado quando o app puder receber TikTok/Meta/social paid.
- [ ] iOS: SKAN/AdServices/ATT/App Privacy/PrivacyInfo revisados e com um unico owner de conversion value.
- [ ] Web/PWA/landing: TikTok Pixel + Events API/UTM capture planejado/implementado quando houver trafego pago/social.
- [ ] Evento de funil minimo definido: app open/install, onboarding completed, ativacao principal, paywall viewed, trial/purchase started, purchase/subscription completed.
- [ ] Reporting central definido: app, channel, campaign, spend, impressions, clicks/taps, installs/leads, CPA/CPT e receita/trial quando existir.
- [ ] Test Events ou equivalente documentado antes de qualquer campanha paga, budget scale, creative refresh pago ou paid launch.
- [ ] Segredos ficam em secret manager/build env/provider env; vault registra somente nomes de env vars e local de armazenamento.

## 1. Ler memoria e padroes

- [ ] Nota do projeto em `02_Projects`.
- [ ] `.brain/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.
- [ ] AI history do projeto.
- [ ] `brain-linear-sync` rodado ou [[04_Areas/Coding/Linear/Linear Git Sync Report]] lido.

# Screenshots Visual QA Checklist

> **Regra zero — sempre awesome, nunca degrada.** Toda screenshot destinada a loja, marketing, post, deck ou capa de release e deliverable de primeira classe. Sai composta, brandada, no formato exato do destino, em todos os idiomas relevantes. Nao existe "screenshot ok pra primeira versao". Cada nova versao deve ser igual ou melhor que a anterior — degradacao visual e regressao e bloqueia release.

## Quando capturar

- [ ] Mudanca visual em tela, componente, landing, dashboard ou app.
- [ ] Novo fluxo de onboarding, auth, pagamento, upload, IA ou deploy.
- [ ] Submission App Store/Google Play — **bloqueador**: sem 6 telas finais composed em cada idioma + device class, nao submete.
- [ ] Resubmission apos rejeicao Apple/Google — refazer set inteiro se o build mudou de jeito visivel.
- [ ] Lancamento de feature consumer — pelo menos 1 hero shot artistico para post/release notes.
- [ ] Bug visual, overflow ou responsividade.
- [ ] Antes/depois de refactor de UI — comparar lado-a-lado.
- [ ] Marketing post, anuncio, deck, video preview — formato e dimensoes do canal final, nao reaproveitar de outro lugar.
- [ ] Site/landing/portfolio com referencia visual externa — capturar referencia e resultado novo em desktop/mobile para comparar.

## Viewports

- [ ] Mobile estreito.
- [ ] Mobile alto.
- [ ] Tablet quando aplicavel.
- [ ] Desktop padrao.
- [ ] Desktop largo quando layout for responsivo.
- [ ] Light/dark mode quando suportado.

## Sites, landings e portfolio high-craft

- [ ] Primeiro viewport mostra marca, pessoa, produto ou objeto principal sem depender de texto pequeno no nav.
- [ ] Se ha referencia visual, o resultado foi comparado contra a referencia por tese visual, movimento, composicao, tipografia, paleta e assets.
- [ ] Ha screenshot do hero e pelo menos um screenshot em scroll state.
- [ ] Canvas/WebGL/SVG animado foi validado como nao branco, nao travado, corretamente enquadrado e respeitando reduced motion quando aplicavel.
- [ ] Foto, produto ou diagrama principal parecem parte do sistema visual, nao colagem.
- [ ] CTA, contato, SEO/Open Graph e favicon foram conferidos quando a pagina e publica.

## "Super awesome" para store/marketing — checklist obrigatorio

- [ ] Composicao branded: brand gradient/textura + headline tipografica + frame de device realista + footer com wordmark/logo.
- [ ] Headline tipografica forte (display font, peso 800+, tamanho >= 100px no 1320px), idealmente com gradient sutil.
- [ ] Eyebrow curta acima do headline (uppercase, letter-spacing alto, cor accent da marca).
- [ ] Subhead em uma linha que explica o beneficio.
- [ ] Frame de device com bezel realista, Dynamic Island/notch correto, side buttons, drop shadow.
- [ ] Screenshot interna mostra produto em uso real, com dados de demo plausiveis (nao login, nao splash, nao tela vazia).
- [ ] Resolucao EXATA do destino:
  - iPhone 6.9": 1320x2868
  - iPhone 6.7": 1290x2796
  - iPhone 6.5": 1242x2688
  - iPhone 5.5": 1242x2208
  - iPad 13": 2064x2752
  - iPad 12.9": 2048x2732
  - Instagram feed: 1080x1350
  - Instagram story: 1080x1920
  - LinkedIn post: 1200x627
- [ ] Status bar: 9:41, bateria 100%, sinal cheio, sem operadora estranha. `xcrun simctl status_bar` ou device fisico ja configurado.
- [ ] Por idioma do mercado (minimo pt-BR + en-US para Brasil/global; adicionar es-MX/es-AR/pt-PT conforme distribuicao).
- [ ] Storytelling: 6 screenshots = arco (hook -> mecanica -> payoff -> social -> monetizacao -> upgrade).
- [ ] Comparada lado-a-lado com a versao anterior: igual ou melhor. Nunca pior.
- [ ] Comparada lado-a-lado com competidor direto: aguenta sem parecer pior.

## O que reprova

- [ ] Texto cortado.
- [ ] Texto ou controles sobrepostos.
- [ ] Botao muda tamanho no hover/loading.
- [ ] Cards dentro de cards sem motivo.
- [ ] Hero generico sem produto/objeto real.
- [ ] Imagem escura, cortada ou decorativa quando deveria explicar produto.
- [ ] Loading/empty/error com layout quebrado.
- [ ] Conteudo principal abaixo da dobra sem sinal visual.
- [ ] Cores muito monocromaticas sem hierarquia.
- [ ] Screenshot cru de simulator/device enviado para loja ou marketing sem composicao.
- [ ] Screenshot em idioma errado para o mercado.
- [ ] Apenas tela de login, splash ou title art (Apple Guideline 2.3.3 reprova).
- [ ] Resolucao aproximada (1290x2796 enviado como 6.9" e errado — Apple aceita mas perde fidelidade).
- [ ] Reaproveitar screenshot de release anterior sem comparar — risco de regressao silenciosa.
- [ ] Screenshot de dependencia, fixture ou `node_modules` tratado como prova do app.

## Evidencia

- [ ] Paths dos screenshots registrados na nota do projeto.
- [ ] Cada screenshot de QA tem interpretacao humana registrada: o que passou, o que falhou, se bloqueia release e qual e o proximo passo.
- [ ] Screenshot em simulador/device compartilhado com outros apps/agentes nao conta como evide

# Secrets And API Keys Register

Este arquivo e inventario. Ele **nao guarda valores reais**.

## Fonte unica local

Variaveis de ambiente compartilhadas vivem em `/Users/paulopierrondi/Projects/.keys.env` (chmod 600, gitignored). Carregamento canonico via `brain-env-run -- <comando>`. Override por projeto: `.env` no diretorio do projeto. Detalhes em [[99_System/Central Env File Operating Model]].

Este register continua sendo **inventario** (nome, owner, projeto, ambiente, status, rotacao). O valor real continua em `/Projects/.keys.env` + Apple Keychain durable + provider env vars de producao.

## Regra

Guardar aqui:

- nome da env var;
- fornecedor;
- projeto;
- ambiente;
- onde o valor real esta guardado;
- data de rotacao;
- dono/responsavel;
- risco e escopo.

Nao guardar aqui:

- API key real;
- token;
- senha;
- cookie;
- private key;
- refresh token;
- service account JSON;
- arquivo `.p8`, `.pem`, `.key`, `.p12`, `.mobileprovision` ou equivalente.

## Locais recomendados para valor real

- `/Users/paulopierrondi/Projects/.keys.env` (chmod 600, gitignored) — fonte unica local; carregar com `brain-env-run`.
- `./.env` do projeto — override quando o projeto precisa de valor diferente do global.
- Apple Keychain via `brain-secret-intake`/`brain-load-secrets` — backing durable do `.env` central.
- 1Password ou outro password manager com referencias seguras, por exemplo `op://Developer/OpenAI/api-key`.
- Apple Passwords / iCloud Keychain para senhas/passkeys humanas.
- GitHub Actions Secrets.
- Vercel/Railway/Netlify/Fly/Render environment variables (producao).
- AWS/GCP/Azure secret manager.

## Modelo de uso

Ver [[99_System/Credential Vault Operating Model]].

- Valor real nunca entra neste arquivo.
- Referencia segura pode entrar, por exemplo `op://vault/item/field`.
- Provider env var pode entrar, por exemplo `Railway Variables -> project/service -> OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- Se `op`/secret manager nao existir no ambiente, deixar acao humana clara em vez de pedir key em chat.
- Intake local seguro disponivel em `/Users/paulopierrondi/.local/bin/brain-secret-intake`; ele pede o valor no prompt do Apple Keychain, sem passar segredo por argumento de shell.
- Intake por arquivo temporario disponivel em `/Users/paulopierrondi/.second-brain-secrets.env`; importar com `/Users/paulopierrondi/.local/bin/brain-secret-intake import /Users/paulopierrondi/.second-brain-secrets.env --delete`.

## Checklist para nova API key

- [ ] Existe env var com nome claro.
- [ ] Valor real esta em secret manager, nao no vault.
- [ ] `.env.example` foi atualizado sem valor real.
- [ ] Se usado arquivo temporario de intake, ele foi apagado apos importacao.
- [ ] Escopo/permissao minima.
- [ ] Ambiente separado: dev/staging/prod.
- [ ] Rotacao/revogacao planejada.
- [ ] Quem usa a key esta documentado.
- [ ] Logs nao imprimem a key.
- [ ] Client nao recebe segredo server-side.

## Incidente de exposicao - 2026-05-19

Valores reais de credenciais foram colados em chat em `2026-05-19`. Tratar como comprometidos. Nenhum valor real deve ser copiado para o vault.

- Antes de agendar/publicar LinkedIn, verificar fila futura e bloquear conteudo fora de ServiceNow.

Todo pedido de criativo deve gerar um pacote, nao apenas uma peca:

- brief;
- roteiro;
- voz;
- legendas;
- visual/b-roll;
- versoes por canal;
- copy de publicacao;
- QA;
- aprendizado/metricas.

### Regra de ouro — Video ads para qualquer app

- Todo ad de app, UGC ou nao UGC, deve passar pelo fluxo nativo `Creative Video Factory` do Pierrondi IA Studio antes de geracao, upload ou publicacao.
- Tela canonica: `/studio/creatives/factory`.
- API canonica: `/api/marketing-os/content-factory/creative-video`.
- Engine canonica: `/Users/paulopierrondi/Projects/pierrondi-ia/lib/marketing-os/content-factory/creative-video-factory.ts`.
- O app standalone `creative-video-factory` e os artefatos do `investcoach_ai` sao biblioteca/prototipo historico, nao a fonte de verdade.
- Primeiro perguntar e registrar: canal principal (`TikTok`, `Instagram`, `LinkedIn`, `YouTube`), objetivo, pago/organico, tela real do app, hook dos 2 primeiros segundos e angulo de venda.
- Sempre que possivel, capturar demo real via Xcode/iOS Simulator antes de usar b-roll generico. A prova de produto deve vir antes de UGC, avatar, Veo ou Pexels.
- O pacote minimo por ad group pago e 4 videos: app real/problema, IA/interface, feature proof, trust/compliance.
- Stack premium preferida: demo real do produto + Veo/Gemini para b-roll + ElevenLabs para voz + Pexels como fallback/complemento.
- Para LinkedIn, manter a regra existente: canal exclusivo de ServiceNow salvo excecao explicita do Paulo.

### Regra de ouro — Paid marketing

- Apple Ads / ASA, Meta, TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn Ads ou qualquer canal pago podem gerar diagnostico e recomendacao diaria.
- Nenhum agente pode pausar, aumentar budget, mudar bid, criar campanha, publicar criativo pago ou alterar target CPA sem aprovacao explicita do Paulo.
- O vault guarda metricas agregadas, decisoes e hipoteses; segredos de API/OAuth ficam fora do vault.
- Para apps financeiros ou IA financeira no TikTok, `TikTok Financial Ads Compliance Runbook` e preflight obrigatorio

# Pierrondi.dev Creative Video OS

## Objetivo

Criar criativos e videos de marketing de alta qualidade para Pierrondi.dev e produtos do portfolio, com um workflow repetivel para LinkedIn, YouTube Shorts, TikTok, Instagram/Reels e campanhas pagas.

O output bom nao e "um video". E um pacote de campanha com roteiro, voz, legendas, assets, variacoes por canal, QA e aprendizado.

## Pierrondi.dev site visual language

O site publico de Paulo deve operar como prova executiva de capacidade, nao como landing generica de IA.

Padrao visual atual:
- preto profundo + branco forte + lime como sinal eletrico;
- campo neural vivo como camada de sistema;
- sinapses/sinais conectando agentes, workflows, governanca, inferencia e plataformas;
- foto executiva integrada ao ambiente visual, sem fundo branco colado;
- diagramas de arquitetura com fluxo de contexto, permissao, acao e evidencia;
- movimento real no scroll, com progress bar, reveal e responsividade;
- copy executiva, sem nome de cliente quando nao houver autorizacao.

Antes de mexer em pierrondi.dev, ler [[04_Areas/Coding/Best Practices/High Craft Frontend Visual Standard]], [[04_Areas/Coding/Best Practices/App Web Quality Best Practices]], [[04_Areas/Coding/Checklists/App Web Preflight Checklist]] e [[04_Areas/Coding/Checklists/Screenshots Visual QA Checklist]].

## Regra de ouro — LinkedIn

- **LinkedIn fica 100% restrito a ServiceNow ate Paulo dizer explicitamente o contrario.**
- Nao usar LinkedIn para campanhas genericas de IA, n8n, WhatsApp, automacao para PME, freelancing, produto digital, apps consumer ou build-in-public.
- LinkedIn pode usar apenas: ServiceNow, Now Assist, AI Agents na ServiceNow, CSDM, CMDB, ITSM/ITOM/SPM, Workflow Data Fabric, AI Control Tower, K26, arquitetura/demos ServiceNow e Bradesco/FSI quando fizer sentido.
- Se um roteiro/copy/video nao passa nesse filtro, gerar para outro canal ou deixar como rascunho nao agendado; nunca agendar/publicar em LinkedIn.

## Regra de ouro — Creative Video Factory

- Todo pedido de video para TikTok, Instagram/Reels, YouTube Shorts, LinkedIn, UGC ou app ads deve passar por `/studio/creatives/factory`.
- A API canonica e `/api/marketing-os/content-factory/creative-video`; novos apps e coders devem chamar esse endpoint, nao criar pipelines standalone.
- O standalone `creative-video-factory` e os assets do InvestCoach ficam como biblioteca/prototipo historico.
- Perguntar sempre: canal, objetivo, pago/organico, tela real do app, hook dos 2 primeiros segundos e angulo de venda.
- Para ad group pago, planejar no minimo 4 videos: app real/problema, IA/interface, feature proof e trust/compliance.
- Sempre que possivel, usar Xcode/iOS Simulator para demo real antes de Veo, Pexels, avatar ou stock.
- Stack premium: demo real + Veo/Gemini para b-roll + ElevenLabs para voz + Pexels como fallback/complemento.
- Apps financeiros: vender organizacao, clareza, educacao e controle; nunca oportunidade financeira, lucro, renda extra, retorno, enriquecimento ou compra/venda de ativos.

## Pipeline atual

1. Brief do tema, publico, oferta e canal.
2. Script generator cria hook, corpo, CTA, b-roll keywords e UTMs.
3. Agent council revisa clareza, promessa, risco, canal e qualidade.
4. ElevenLabs gera voz com timestamps.
5. Captions convertem timestamps em palavras e ASS karaoke.
6. Visual usa criativos curados primeiro, background videos depois, Pexels como fallback.
7. Render FFmpeg local gera MP4 1080x1920.
8. Creatomate fica como backend premium opcional.
9. QA valida duracao, audio, legenda, safe zone, black frames, CTA, links e formato.
10. Publicacao fica em draft/review/approval antes de ir para canal externo.
11. Metricas entram no aprendizado para remix.

## Regra de qualidade

- Primeiro frame precisa explicar por que parar o scroll.
- Primeiros 2 segundos precisam ter tese, contraste ou prova.
- O roteiro precisa soar falado, nao escrito.
- Legenda precisa ser legivel sem audio e sem cobrir UI do canal.
- Voz precisa combinar com o canal: LinkedIn mais autoridade, TikTok/Ree

# ElevenLabs Voice And Subtitle Workflow

## Objetivo

Gerar voz natural e legendas sincronizadas para videos de marketing, sem perder qualidade, acessibilidade ou controle de seguranca.

## Fluxo recomendado

1. Escrever roteiro falado, curto e com pausas naturais.
2. Escolher voz por objetivo: founder, autoridade tecnica, energia social, corporate ou analitica.
3. Gerar TTS no ElevenLabs usando endpoint com timestamps.
4. Salvar audio como asset do render, nunca em Markdown.
5. Converter timestamps por caractere para timings por palavra.
6. Gerar dois tipos de legenda:
   - ASS burned-in karaoke para Shorts/TikTok/Reels.
   - SRT sidecar para YouTube e LinkedIn.
7. Renderizar MP4 1080x1920 com FFmpeg local.
8. Rodar QA de sincronia, legibilidade e safe zone.
9. Registrar no projeto: voice slug, roteiro, caminhos de assets, render ID e aprendizados.

## ElevenLabs no repo

- Adapter: `/Users/paulopierrondi/Projects/pierrondi-ia/lib/marketing-os/voice/elevenlabs.ts`
- Captions: `/Users/paulopierrondi/Projects/pierrondi-ia/lib/marketing-os/video/captions.ts`
- Env vars:
  - `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`
  - `ELEVENLABS_PAULO_VOICE_ID`
  - `JARVIS_ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID`
  - `ELEVENLABS_DEFAULT_VOICE_ID`

## Regras de roteiro para voz

- Escrever como fala: frases curtas, sem paragrafo longo.
- Evitar siglas sem explicar na primeira vez.
- Colocar pausa onde o video precisa respirar.
- Nao pedir "voz viral"; pedir emocao operacional: calmo, urgente, professoral, provocativo, executivo, founder-led.
- Para PT-BR: revisar acentos, nomes proprios, pronuncia de siglas e palavras inglesas.
- Para EN: evitar literalismo do portugues; reescrever a ideia.

## Legendas

### Burned-in

Use em TikTok, Reels e Shorts quando a retencao depende de ler sem audio.

- 1 ou 2 linhas.
- Janela curta de 3 a 5 palavras.
- Contraste forte e outline.
- Nao ocupar topo com hooks longos.
- Evitar rodape baixo: UI do TikTok/Reels/Shorts cobre a area inferior.
- Usar highlights com parcimonia: uma palavra ativa por vez e suficiente.

### Sidecar

Use como arquivo separado quando a plataforma aceita closed captions.

- YouTube: SRT e VTT sao formatos aceitos; SRT UTF-8 e o default simples.
- LinkedIn: usar SRT simples; nao depender de cor, fonte ou markup.
- Manter o SRT master junto do render e registrar o path.

## Conversao de timing

ElevenLabs retorna `alignment` e `normalized_alignment` com timestamps por caractere. O pipeline deve:

1. preferir `normalized_alignment` quando texto foi normalizado;
2. agrupar caracteres nao-espaco em palavras;
3. usar inicio do primeiro caractere e fim do ultimo;
4. snapar cortes para limites de palavra;
5. validar que o ultimo timestamp fica perto da duracao real do audio.

## QA de voz

- [ ] Voz nao parece leitura monotona.
- [ ] Nomes proprios e termos tecnicos corretos.
- [ ] Pacing cabe no tempo alvo.
- [ ] Sem respiracao, riso ou tag textual renderizada por acidente.
- [ ] Audio sem clipping.
- [ ] Legenda bate com a fala.
- [ ] CTA falado e visivel.
- [ ] Sem uso de voz clonada sem consentimento.

Para todos os files e automacoes locais, a fonte canonica de variaveis de ambiente e `/Users/paulopierrondi/Projects/.keys.env`, carregada via `/Users/paulopierrondi/.local/bin/brain-env-run`. Detalhes em [[99_System/Central Env File Operating Model]].

- `chmod 600` obrigatorio.
- Nunca commitar; nunca colar em chat, Markdown, Linear, screenshot, log ou email.
- Producao continua em provider env vars (Railway/Vercel/GitHub Actions), nunca neste `.env`.
- Override por projeto: `.env` local do projeto vence sobre o central.
- Scripts novos: `brain-env-run -- <comando>` em vez de `source .env` ou `python-dotenv` cru.

## Permitido no vault

- Nome de env var.
- Nome do fornecedor.
- Projeto que usa a chave.
- Ambiente: local, staging, prod.
- Local onde o valor real esta guardado.
- Data de criacao/rotacao.
- Dono/responsavel.
- Escopo/permissao da chave.
- Procedimento de revogacao.

## Proibido no vault

- Valores reais de API keys.
- Tokens de acesso ou refresh tokens.
- Senhas.
- Cookies.
- Private keys.
- Service account JSON.
- Certificados privados.
- Arquivos `.env` completos.
- Screenshots que mostrem credenciais.

## Padrao para projetos

- `/Users/paulopierrondi/Projects/.keys.env` (chmod 600) como fonte unica de variaveis compartilhadas; carregar via `brain-env-run`.
- `./.env` no diretorio do projeto apenas para overrides especificos (precedence wins).
- `.env.example` com nomes e valores falsos no repo.
- Secret manager/provider env vars para producao.
- GitHub Actions Secrets para CI.
- Nunca passar segredo para LLM quando nao for estritamente necessario.

## Regra para coders

- Default para automacoes locais: `brain-env-run -- <comando>` (carrega o `.env` central + override de projeto).
- Nao pedir Paulo para colar API key/token em chat quando houver alternativa.
- Consultar [[04_Areas/Coding/Checklists/Secrets And API Keys Register]] e usar a referencia/local de armazenamento.
- Preferir `op://...` + `op run` quando 1Password CLI estiver disponivel.
- Se o secret manager nao estiver configurado, registrar acao humana e bloquear a parte que depende do segredo.

## Quando uma key vaza

1. Revogar imediatamente no fornecedor.
2. Criar nova key com permissao minima.
3. Atualizar secret manager/provider.
4. Rodar testes/deploy necessario.
5. Registrar incidente na nota do projeto sem repetir a key.
6. Procurar e remover vazamento em logs/commits se aplicavel.

Incidente aberto: [[99_System/Secret Exposure Incident - 2026-05-19]].

## Intake local seguro

Quando 1Password CLI ainda nao estiver disponivel, usar `/Users/paulopierrondi/.local/bin/brain-secret-intake` para gravar valores novos/rotacionados no Apple Keychain. O script nao recebe segredo por argumento; ele deixa o proprio Keychain pedir o valor.

Runbook manual no vault: [[99_System/Manual Credential Intake]].

Para importacao em lote, usar arquivo temporario fora do vault:

```bash
/Users/paulopierrondi/.local/bin/brain-secret-intake import /Users/paulopierrondi/.second-brain-secrets.env --delete
```

O arquivo temporario nao deve entrar em Obsidian, Git, Linear, email ou screenshot.
